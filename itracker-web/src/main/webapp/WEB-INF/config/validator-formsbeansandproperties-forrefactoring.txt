These form beans have existed as DynaValidatorForms, 
but now are being refactored into real FormBeans. 
But we have forgotten about the Validation Configuration 
for them. We have to do it. 

It seems like we have to insert <form> definitions into
the validator configurations. This is because in
earlier code there was DynaValidatorForms but now we
have real FormBeans (which are better because they get
checked in the IDE before compiling), but now we need
to tell the Struts framework which fields need to be
validated (the fields from the form beans are required
usually).

Take a look at the ReportForm Validator definition in the
validation-module-admin.xml
for example.
