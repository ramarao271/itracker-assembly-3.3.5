# This property can be used to override the url determined dynamically
# by the system when a user submits an issue or self registers.  This
# is mainly due to some users using private domain names that wouldn't
# be accessible to all recipients of a notification email.  This
# property is only used to create urls in emails sent to all users.
#system_base_url=http://${application.host}:${application.port}/${application.path}
