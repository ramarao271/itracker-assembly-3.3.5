  Upgraded core struts libraries to the 1.1 final version.

  New Features:

    - Broke Assign Self into two permissions, Assign Self now allows users to assign an
      issue to themselves, Unassign Self allows users who are currently the owner of an issue

    edit form and view form.
  o Fixed bug with attachments and mysql that prevented any attachment over 65k
    from being stored.

Version 2.3.1 (Development)
---------------------------
  New Features:
  o Moved custom fields from resources bundles into the database
  o Added the ability to import users, projects, issues into ITracker from an XML file
  o Added attachment support to the API
  o Updated the API to allow for issue updates

  Feature Changes:
  o Changed all session ejbs, except the web services ones, to only use local
    interfaces
  o The plugable authentication interfaces and classes were changed to allow
    for other types of authentication information than passwords (shared secrets,
    certificates), and to differentiate requestors (eg web app, api).
  o The plugable authentication now checks both request attributes, and then if form
    data, for plain text and encrypted password data.
  o The plugable authentication was extended to check if certian types of
    user information is allowed to be processed through ITracker.  The supported
    types are core profile, password, preferences, and permissions.
  o The plugable authentication was changed to so that permissions are pulled
    from the authentication source.
  o Added better i18n support for mysql.  Changes to the db creation scripts
    and a new filter for request processing.
  o Added code to support custom fields and attachments in an export
  o Changed the XML to use both a system ID and a unique id for better DOM support
  o Changed the resources bundles so an individual key could be updated.  This
    allows the system to update cached values without reloading all the locales.
  o Added code to surpress component and version sections on forms if none are defined
    for the project
  o Changed all attachments to be stored in the database form the filesystem.  This
    makes them more portable and also accessible from the EJB's
  o Added in code to move preexisting attachments into the database

  Fixes:
  o Fixed a bug in edit preferences where the form would not load correctly.
  o Fixed a bug where the option value would be displayed instead of the label
    on list custom fields.

    circumstances.
  o Fixed a bug where the activity owner wasn't set correctly when an owner was
    assigned to an issue when it was created.
  o Fixed a bug where translated help files couldn't be loaded.  Now the name of the
    new page is as a resource property.
  o Fixed a bug where the last permission on a project for a user couldn't be removed.
  o Fixed some bugs when updating a language online.
  o Fixed a bug where on the issue create screen some of the data would be lost if
    the page did not pass validation.
  o Fixed error handling on report page when no project is selected.
  o Fixed some forms to always use session based attributes for data.  This allows
    validation to work better if javascript is disabled.  There was no need for request
    based attributes since all forms were using transactional support that prevented a
    user from having more than one form open at a time (in a single session).
  o Fixed code so that users with Edit User's permission can be issue owners.
  o Fixed spacing between columns on main page and list issues to make it easier to read
    when fields are close together

  Feature Changes:
  o Changed some database column names to allow for firebird support
  o Moved the scheduler classes to the web package from ejb.  Any custom tasks
    will need to be updated

    preference was also added to disable this feature
  o Changed issue export to provide more information so it can be used in
    the new import feature
  o Changed all jsp pages to use UTF-8 encoding

    permision is a limited edit, the user can only change the description, and add
    new history entries and attachments

  Fixes:
  o Fixed problem in IssueSearchHandler where statements weren't being closed
  o Fixed bug where new projects could not be created

---------------------------
  New Features:
  o Added custom attributes to issues/projects.  This allows an adminstrator
    to add custom, per-project fields to issues easily.
  o Changed authentication to be plugable.  By writing your own class, you can
    change the source of user authentication.  Currently users must still be
    created on ITracker, but you can use an external source to authenticate
    whether a new registration is allowed.  Also things like user password
    changes on ITracker won't actually change the password in the remote system.
  o Added new ability to move an issue into a different project

  o Fixed a bug where user permissions were not being loaded unless you
    were a superuser.


Version 1.7.1 (Development)
--------------------------
  Feature Changes:
  o Changed locking for JBoss to NoLock.  This means that without changes
    to the jboss.xml file, ITracker will only run on JBoss version 3.0.3+.
    If you wish to run it on an older version, you will need to change
    the entity locking back to MethodOnlyEJBLock from NoLock.
  o Changed code to make it easier to add reports.  Now the only changes
    required is adding a new line to struts_config.xml, listing the report
    in the ResourceBundle and adding the report to the directory.

    preferences was set to an empty string
  o Added code to clear session info if any error occurs during login
  o Fixed problem with help displaying

    the resource bundles
  o Added user preference to let an individuals pick the locale the
    site will be displayed in.

    issue in the history entries automatically.  The list of words are
    controled through the resource bundles.
  o Added a targeted version to an issue to track when issues will be fixed.

  Feature Changes:
  o Added code to the my preferences page so that no password information
    is displayed, and the current password is required to submit the form.
  o Changed passwords to be saved as SHA1 hashes in the database

  API Changes:
  o Redesigned the web services API to use the existing EJB's.  New service
    now supports issue retrieval, and project information

Version 1.5.1 (Development)
---------------------------
  New Features:
  o Added support for authenticated email
  o Added self registration.  Each project can be independently configured
    to allow self registration access.  By default a self registered user will
    not have access to projects.  A project must enable the create option
    and/or the view_all options to give those permissions to newly self_registered
    users.  Other permissions must be added through the normal user administration
    process.

    function for the server

  Fixes:
  o Fixed bug in search page compilation
  o Fixed bug where search results weren't being cleared

Version 1.5.0 (Development)
---------------------------
  New Features:
  o Added issue owner to the notification emails
  o Added ability for a user to unassign an issue if they can at least assign it
    to themself.  This allows people to put it back into a status when a person
    who has the ability to assign it to others see it on their myITracker page
  o Changed status values to be larger values so new statuses can be inserted
    in between them easier.  Also added new unassigned status for when the issue
    was previously assigned but no longer has an owner.
  o Added hiding of permissions on the user admin screen when a project
    is locked
  o Added code to allow a super user to delete (hide) history entries and
    override the status of an issue.
  o Added basic csv export for import into a spreadsheet program
  o Added project specific options (surpress HTML in history, allow assigned
    to closed status, and using a fixed set of resolution entries)

  o Changed owner names to use first initial on the index page to match the
    other pages

    only available for viewing/searching
  o Added more functions to web services API
  o Average Time Per User Report contributed by Anthony Di Paola

  Fixes:
  o Fixed the incredibly annoying ApplicationDeadlockExceptions in JBoss.
    This was done by changing the entity access in the container config in
    the jboss.xml file.  Many, many thanks to Arthur Wang for fixing this.
  o Fixed mysql database scripts to not use timestamps.  This was causing
    the create dates to constantly reset.
  o Major bug in WebLogic deployment descriptor exactly like the JBoss one.
    This caused the many-to-many relations ships to be stored in the wrong
    columns in the database.  This had to be changed to facilitate changes
    to the search engine. If you wish to keep your existing component,
    version, and project owner relationships you must use SQL to rename the
    columns.  The installation instructions have more info.
  o Changed code so only active (not locked) users can have issues assigned
  o Changed code so only active (not locked) users can be project owners.
    Locking a user removes them as a project owner from all projects.
  o Fixed compilation bug in issue search page
  o Fixed bug with some image urls in the header and index pages
  o Changed charset to ISO-8859-1 to see if that fixes international
    character issues

  o Updated reports to use JFreechart 0.9.2
  o Updated web services client to use Apache Axis
  o Changed code to allow JNDI names to be changed, and changed
    references to follow the J2EE standards better

  Fixes:
  o Major bug in JBoss deployment descriptor caused the many-to-many
    relations ships to be stored in the wrong columns in the database.
    This had to be changed to facilitate changes to the search engine.
    If you wish to keep your existing component, version, and project owner
    relationships you must use SQL to rename the columns.  The installation
    instructions have more info.

      1) deplyws
      2) undeployws
      3) testws
